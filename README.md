nitor - latin: to strive, exert oneself, make an effort, persevere.

This is a codebase for building an _indoor_ climbing routes database
and web service with added chrome and fun.

It's an experiment in bringing together the two things I spend the most
time working on: tiddlyweb and climbing.

This is far from done or useful yet and will likely change a great 
deal over time but the expected features are:

* per gym "themes"
* admin and gym management interfaces
* climber ticklists
* papercraft output
* API access for arbitrary devices (e.g. iphones etc)

While there is no particular reason why TiddlyWeb is better at providing
these services than anything else, there are some benefits:

* I already know how to use the stuff.
* Built in multi-representation API (notably JSON and Atom).
* Already wired for queues via dispatcher and beanstalkd.
* Expands and extends the key-value database aspect of TiddlyWeb.
* Provides another vector from which Tiddly* improvements can come.
