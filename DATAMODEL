Some notes on trying to keep track of the data model in nitor, since
bags are being used in a "special" way.

This needs to also record how tags are being used but does not, yet.
The current code references annotations on climbs by having the same
title. This will not scale. Annotations need to point to a climb by
a field which references. Then we can unwind the tree as needed.

! Gyms

The bag named 'gyms' contains tiddlers with titles that are the code
of the gym (e.g. rcc). Each gym gets three bags, using the rcc example:

* rcc_news: each tiddler is a news item
* rcc_climbs: each tiddler is a record of a current route
* rcc_archive: each tiddler is a route that is no longer "up"

! Misc

The bag called 'climbtypes' has tiddlers which have title being the
shorthand of a climb type, with text as the full description.

! Users

Each user gets one bag, into which go tiddlers that have titles that same
as routes stored in the '_climbs' bags. Something desired to be climbed is
tagged 'tickwish'. Something climbed is tagged 'climb'. Other fields can be
used to do things like store comments.

Each user will eventually have a tiddler in the MAGICUSER bag which 
operates, effectively, as a profile and account settings container.

! Roles

Some users are 'MANAGER', meaning they are responsible for keeping 
gym data up to date. Some users are 'ADMIN', meaning they can create
new gyms or update gym info.
